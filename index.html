<h1>About</h1>
 
 
<p>The deep learning reading group is organized jointly by the Mistis, Perception and Thoth project-teams based at Inria Grenoble – Rhône-Alpes. The group meets about once every two or three weeks to discuss topics of interest (basic concepts as well as recent research papers in deep learning). It is open to anyone at Inria or Université Grenoble Alpes willing to participate actively. Interested people with other affiliations are also welcome, but are requested to contact one of the organizers.</p>
