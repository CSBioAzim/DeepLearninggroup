# DeepLearninggroup
The deep learning reading group is organized jointly by Lisa Handl and Azim Dehghani Amirabad . The group meets bi-weekly to discuss topics of interest (basic concepts as well as recent research papers in deep learning). It is open to anyone at Max Planck Institute for Informatics or Saarland University. Interested people with other affiliations are also welcome, but are requested to contact us.
